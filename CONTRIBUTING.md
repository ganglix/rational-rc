## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Follow the modular design used in Rational-RC. Examples include submodules like `chloride`, `carbonation`, and `corrosion`.
- Name your files, functions, and classes clearly and consistently with existing conventions.

### Testing and Validation
- All new functionality should be covered with appropriate test cases that ensure correctness and reproducibility.
- Contributions must pass the existing test suite before being merged.
- If you're adding a new deterioration model:
  - Base it on validated theoretical formulations or peer-reviewed studies.
  - Clearly cite all sources and provide assumptions.
  - Note: Physical or experimental validation is outside the scope of this repository and should be documented separately (e.g., peer-reviewed publications).

### Documentation
- Include clear docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Update or add documentation (e.g., usage examples, explanations of new models) to help users understand and apply your additions.
- Reference the documentation site where appropriate:  
  [https://rational-rc.readthedocs.io](https://rational-rc.readthedocs.io)
