Introduction
============

Tinkrete is a practical life cycle deterioration modelling framework. 
It utilizes the field survey data and provides probabilistic predictions of the RC structure deterioration through different stages of the service life cycle. 
It covers various deterioration mechanisms such as membrane deterioration, concrete carbonation and chloride penetration, corrosion and cracking.
